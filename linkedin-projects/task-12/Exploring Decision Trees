🌳 Exploring Decision Trees on Synthetic Data 🌐

Excited to share a recent project where I delved into the fascinating world of Decision Trees! 🚀

Overview
I recently worked on implementing a Decision Tree classifier on synthetic data, aiming to create a simple yet effective binary classification model. The goal was to gain insights into the decision-making process of the tree and visualize its structure.

Steps
1️⃣ Synthetic Data Generation: Created a synthetic dataset with two features and a binary target variable based on a straightforward rule.

2️⃣ Data Splitting: Split the dataset into training and testing sets using scikit-learn to ensure model evaluation on an independent subset.

3️⃣ Decision Tree Classifier Creation: Developed a Decision Tree classifier using scikit-learn, a powerful tool for interpretable models in machine learning.

4️⃣ Model Training: Trained the Decision Tree on the training data, allowing the model to learn decision-making patterns.

5️⃣ Prediction and Evaluation: Used the trained model to make predictions on the test set and evaluated accuracy using scikit-learn's accuracy_score function.

6️⃣ Visualization: Visualized the Decision Tree structure using the plot_tree function, gaining insights into its decision nodes and leaf nodes.

Results
📊 The project resulted in a highly accurate Decision Tree classifier on synthetic data, providing a clear understanding of its decision-making process.

Conclusion
🌐 This project serves as an introduction to Decision Trees, offering a blend of learning and analysis. The visualization aspect enhances comprehension, making it a valuable tool for both enthusiasts and practitioners.
