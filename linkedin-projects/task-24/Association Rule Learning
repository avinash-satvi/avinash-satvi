🚀 Exciting News in Association Rule Learning! 🚀

I'm thrilled to share the details of my recent project on Association Rule Learning using the Apriori algorithm. 🧠✨

Project Highlights:
1️⃣ Synthetic Dataset Generation: Created a synthetic dataset with adjustable parameters like the number of transactions, items per transaction, and possible items.

2️⃣ Apriori Algorithm Implementation: Applied the powerful Apriori algorithm to unearth frequent itemsets and association rules. The algorithm intelligently prunes infrequent itemsets to focus on meaningful associations.

3️⃣ Sequential Pattern Mining: Delved into sequential pattern mining using the PrefixSpan algorithm from pymining. This aspect explores patterns in the order of occurrences within sequences of transactions.

Streamlit Dashboard:
The project comes with an interactive Streamlit dashboard for a user-friendly experience.

🎛 Sidebar Settings: Control parameters such as the number of transactions, items per transaction, and possible items.

⚙️ Algorithm Settings: Tune the minimum support and confidence thresholds for effective pattern discovery.

📊 Results Display: Explore discovered frequent itemsets, association rules, and sequential patterns.

📈 Visualizations: Engage with insightful visualizations including itemset frequency distribution, support threshold trends, rule metrics, and more!
