🔍 Exploring Independent Component Analysis (ICA) with a Synthetic Dataset!

🚀 Excited to share a project where I implemented ICA using scikit-learn and a synthetic dataset. ICA is a powerful technique for blind source separation, and this project showcases its application.

🧑‍💻 Project Highlights:

Synthetic Data Generation: Created a dataset with three independent components.
Mixing Matrix Magic: Mixed components to generate observed data.
FastICA Implementation: Applied scikit-learn's FastICA to recover independent components.
📊 Visualizations Galore:

Time Series Plots
Histograms
Scatter Plots
Pairwise Component Comparison
Source Separation Plots
Power Spectral Density (PSD) Plots
Biplot or Mixing Matrix Visualization
Kurtosis Values
3D Scatter Plots
🔧 Experimentation Encouraged:
Feel free to tweak parameters, the mixing matrix, or introduce complexities for hands-on exploration.

👩‍💻 Key Takeaway:
This project is a dive into ICA's capabilities for source separation. Explore, experiment, and let's spark discussions! 🔥
