🚀 Exciting News in Sentiment Analysis! 🚀

Hey LinkedIn fam! 👋 I wanted to share an awesome sentiment analysis project I've been working on using BERT models and web scraping. 🤖📊

What it does:
I've built a sentiment analysis pipeline that uses BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) to analyze the sentiment of text extracted from webpages. 🌐✨ The goal is to understand the sentiment (positive, negative, or neutral) of articles or content from various URLs.

Key Features:

🧠 Bert-based Model: Leveraging the power of BERT for sequence classification.
🌐 Web Scraping: Extracting text from webpages using BeautifulSoup.
📈 Sentiment Labeling: Converting numerical labels to human-readable sentiment labels.
🔄 Batch Processing: Analyzing sentiment for multiple URLs in a single go.
📊 Radar Chart: Visualizing sentiment analysis results in a cool radar chart using Matplotlib and NumPy.
Example Result:
I tested it on a recent article from Indian Express. The sentiment was [Positive] with a confidence score of [0.85]. 🌟

Why it Matters:
Understanding sentiment is crucial in today's digital landscape. This tool can help gauge public opinion, assess brand perception, and much more!

Feel free to explore the code and try it out with your favorite articles. The possibilities are endless! 🚀
