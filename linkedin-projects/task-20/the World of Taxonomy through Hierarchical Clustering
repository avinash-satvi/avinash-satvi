🔍 Exploring the World of Taxonomy through Hierarchical Clustering! 🌐🔬

I recently undertook a fascinating project applying Hierarchical Clustering to a synthetic taxonomy dataset, delving into the intricate relationships between genera and species. 🌿 Let's dive into the key highlights:

Objective:
The aim was to showcase the power of Hierarchical Clustering in grouping similar data points, providing a structured hierarchy of relationships. 🧬

Dataset Creation:
A synthetic taxonomy dataset was generated, featuring diverse genera and species with assigned numeric traits. This artificial dataset served as an ideal playground for demonstrating clustering techniques. 🎲

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Summary Statistics: Revealed insights into central tendency and dispersion of numeric traits.
Unique Genera and Species: Unveiled the richness of diversity within the dataset.
Genus Counts: Visualized the distribution of genera, highlighting their frequency.
Average Numeric Traits by Genus: Explored hierarchical clustering to understand trait patterns across genera.
Subset Analysis:
Focused on 'species_1', uncovering specific characteristics and visualizing Trait_A vs. Trait_B through a scatter plot. 📊

Unique Species per Genus:
Examined the number of unique species for each genus, emphasizing the diversity within genera through a captivating bar chart. 📈

Visualizations:
A blend of visualizations enhanced the storytelling:

Histograms: Unveiled the distribution of numeric traits across the dataset.
Pie Chart: Displayed the proportional distribution of genera in a visually engaging manner.
Word Cloud: Added a touch of creativity, showcasing unique species names.
Scatter Plot: Brought 'species_1' to life, revealing relationships between Trait_A and Trait_B.
Bar Chart: Illustrated the count of unique species per genus, offering a comparative view.
Conclusion:
The project successfully demonstrated the application of Hierarchical Clustering in unraveling complex relationships within a taxonomy dataset. 🌐✨

Future Work:
Future explorations may involve advanced clustering algorithms and real biological datasets for a deeper understanding. The journey into biological taxonomy continues! 🔬🚀
