🚀 Exploring Bagging Classifier with Synthetic Data 🚀

Excited to share my recent project where I delved into the fascinating world of Bagging Classifiers using a synthetic dataset! 🌐

Overview:
The project aimed to implement and analyze a Bagging Classifier, an ensemble learning technique, on a synthetic dataset. This hands-on exploration helped me understand how combining predictions from multiple models enhances performance and robustness.

Key Steps:
1️⃣ Synthetic Dataset Generation:
Generated a controlled synthetic dataset with 1000 samples, 20 features, and 2 classes using make_classification from sklearn.datasets.

2️⃣ Dataset Splitting:
Split the synthetic dataset into training and testing sets (80-20 ratio) using train_test_split from sklearn.model_selection.

3️⃣ Bagging Classifier Implementation:
Implemented the Bagging Classifier using BaggingClassifier from sklearn.ensemble with a decision tree as the base estimator.

4️⃣ Evaluation:
Evaluated the Bagging Classifier's performance on the test set and calculated accuracy using accuracy_score from sklearn.metrics.

5️⃣ Visualization of Decision Boundaries:
Created a function to visualize decision boundaries in a 2D plane using the first two features of the synthetic dataset.

6️⃣ Hyperparameter Tuning:
Tuned hyperparameters via grid search (GridSearchCV) to optimize the Bagging Classifier's performance.

7️⃣ Visualizing Feature Importance:
Visualized feature importance of the base decision tree with a bar plot.

8️⃣ Analyzing Misclassifications:
Analyzed misclassified points on the test set to gain insights into patterns the Bagging Classifier struggles to capture.

9️⃣ Extended Visualization of Decision Regions:
Added an extended visualization to plot decision regions using all features for a comprehensive view of the classifier's behavior.

🔟 Learning Curve:
Generated a learning curve illustrating how the Bagging Classifier's accuracy changes with the number of training examples.

Conclusion and Next Steps:
This project provided a comprehensive understanding of Bagging Classifiers. Future steps may involve experimenting with different base models, exploring additional ensemble techniques, and applying insights to real-world datasets.
