🚀 Excited to share the highlights of my latest project: Exploring Feedforward Neural Networks with Synthetic Data! 🧠💻

In this project, I delved into the fascinating world of feedforward neural networks using synthetic data. Here's a quick overview of what I've been up to:

🔍 Synthetic Data Generation: Generated synthetic data using scikit-learn's make_classification and make_regression functions. Simulated various scenarios to understand neural network behavior.

📊 Data Visualization: Explored the synthetic data through scatter plots, histograms, and pair plots. Analyzed distribution, relationships between features, and computed descriptive statistics.

🛠️ Model Building: Built a feedforward neural network model using TensorFlow and Keras. Employed two hidden layers with ReLU activation functions and the Adam optimizer.

📈 Training Visualization: Visualized the training process with line plots showing training and validation loss over epochs. Monitored mean absolute error (MAE) to track model performance.

📊 Model Evaluation: Evaluated the model on test data, calculating metrics such as mean squared error (MSE) and MAE. Visualized model predictions against actual values using scatter plots.

💡 Activation and Weight Visualization: Visualized activations and weights of different layers to understand information flow and feature importance in the model's decision-making process.

📉 Prediction Visualization: Visualized decision boundaries for classification tasks and scatter plots for regression tasks. Gained insights into the model's generalization on unseen data.

🎉 This project has been an incredible journey into the world of neural networks and synthetic data. It's amazing to see how these technologies can be leveraged to understand complex data patterns and make accurate predictions.
