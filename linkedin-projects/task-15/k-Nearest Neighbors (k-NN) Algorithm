🚀 Exploring k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN) Algorithm with Synthetic Data 🚀

📊 Project Overview:
Just wrapped up a fascinating project exploring the k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN) algorithm using synthetic data! 🤖 I wanted to understand how k-NN behaves in different scenarios and visualize its decision boundaries. Here's a quick rundown of what I discovered:

🔍 Insights:

Dataset Generation: Created a synthetic dataset with 2 features and 2 classes.
Implementation: Used scikit-learn to implement k-NN, experimenting with various parameters.
Visualization: Plotted decision boundaries on both training and testing sets.
📈 Results:

Explored the impact of changing the number of neighbors (k) on model performance.
Evaluated the model using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
Visualized the scatter plot, decision boundaries, confusion matrix, ROC curve, and precision-recall curve.
🌐 Significance:
Understanding k-NN is crucial for its applications in classification tasks. The project sheds light on how different parameters influence outcomes and emphasizes the importance of careful model evaluation.

🛠 Next Steps:
Considering additional enhancements like weighted k-NN and experimenting with diverse datasets for comparison. Always seeking ways to improve and refine the approach!
