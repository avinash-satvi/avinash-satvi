🚀 Exploring Linear Regression on Synthetic Data

Excited to share a simple Python script showcasing the power of linear regression on synthetic datasets! 📊 This code generates a synthetic dataset, introduces non-linear relationships, and applies linear regression for prediction.

Key Highlights:

🛠 Utilizes make_regression from scikit-learn to create a synthetic dataset.
📈 Introduces a non-linear relationship by squaring one of the features.
🚀 Trains a Linear Regression model to predict outcomes.
📉 Evaluates model performance using Mean Squared Error (MSE).
📊 Visualizes actual vs. predicted values on the test set.
