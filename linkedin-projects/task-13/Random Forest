🚀 Random Forest Project Highlights 🌳

1️⃣ Synthetic Dataset Generation:
Generated a synthetic dataset with 1000 samples and 10 features for binary classification (0: Not Fraud, 1: Fraud).

2️⃣ Data Exploration:
Visualized target variable distribution and feature characteristics using histograms and box plots.

3️⃣ Data Preprocessing:
Split the dataset into training and testing sets (80-20 split).

4️⃣ Random Forest Model Building:
Trained a Random Forest classifier with 100 trees.

5️⃣ Model Evaluation:
Assessed model performance on the test set using accuracy, a classification report, and a confusion matrix.

6️⃣ Feature Importance:
Visualized feature importance using a bar plot.

7️⃣ Hyperparameter Tuning:
Used GridSearchCV to find optimal hyperparameters for the Random Forest model.

8️⃣ Model Evaluation with Tuned Hyperparameters:
Reassessed model performance with tuned hyperparameters.

9️⃣ Model Interpretation using SHAP:
Calculated SHAP values to interpret model predictions and understand feature importance.

🔟 SHAP Summary Plot:
Generated a summary plot to visualize feature impacts on model predictions.

🔍 Conclusion:
The Random Forest model has been trained, evaluated, and interpreted. Key findings include important features for fraud prediction. Exciting potential for real-world applications! 🌐📊 #DataScience #MachineLearning #RandomForest
