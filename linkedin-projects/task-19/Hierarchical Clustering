🚀 Exploring Hierarchical Clustering with Python

I recently worked on a project to delve into the fascinating world of hierarchical clustering using Python. Here's a glimpse of what I accomplished:

Objective:
The goal was to showcase the application of hierarchical clustering on a synthetic dataset. Hierarchical clustering is a powerful unsupervised learning technique used to group similar data points.

Dataset Generation:
I generated a synthetic dataset with two distinct clusters, each containing 20 data points. This was done by sampling random values from normal distributions.

Hierarchical Clustering:
I utilized the Ward method, a linkage criterion, to measure dissimilarity between clusters. The SciPy library's linkage function helped create a linkage matrix capturing relationships between data points.

Dendrogram Visualization:
A dendrogram, a tree diagram, was created to illustrate the hierarchical clustering process. It showcased how data points were grouped based on their distances.

Additional Visualizations:
To enhance understanding, I provided four types of visualizations:

📈 Scatter Plot: Showcasing the synthetic dataset with two distinct clusters.
🌐 Heat Map: Displaying pairwise distances between data points.
🌲 Tree Diagram: Emphasizing the hierarchical structure of the clusters.
🚀 3D Scatter Plot: Adding an extra dimension to the visualization for alternative perspectives.
Conclusion:
The project successfully demonstrated hierarchical clustering's application and offered insights into interpreting clustering results. This serves as a foundation for real-world applications in various fields such as biological taxonomy, image segmentation, or customer segmentation in marketing.
