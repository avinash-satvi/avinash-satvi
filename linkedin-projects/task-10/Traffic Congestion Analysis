🚗 Traffic Congestion Analysis Project 🚦

Excited to share the highlights of a recent project where I delved into Traffic Congestion Analysis using machine learning and data visualization techniques. 🌐📊

Traffic Congestion Prediction:

Trained a Random Forest classifier to predict traffic congestion based on various features.
Achieved [Model Accuracy: 93.62%].
Data Exploration:

Conducted in-depth data exploration, including summary statistics and visualizations.
Explored time series patterns, correlation between features, and relationships among numerical variables.
Data Visualization:

📈 Time Series Plot: Visualized trends in traffic patterns over time.
📊 Correlation Heatmap: Examined relationships between different features.
🔄 Pair Plot of Numerical Features: Analyzed interactions among numerical variables.
Visualization of Results:

📊 Box Plot and Violin Plot: Explored the distribution of vehicle counts for different types.
🗺️ Traffic Congestion Map: Mapped traffic congestion spatially for a comprehensive view.
Conclusion:
Summarized key findings, insights, and recommendations based on the analyses conducted.

This project offered valuable insights into traffic patterns and congestion, paving the way for smarter urban planning and traffic management. 🚀
